Exercise 0 - obtaining Vampire:
-------------------------------

The source code of Vampire is available at 

https://github.com/vprover/vampire

for evaluation and research purposes (see LICENCE there for more details).

Full official vampire, that we will be using, requires the SMT solver Z3 as a library.

Z3 has been pre-installed on the provided VM. 

(In general, make sure there is sub-directory "include" of your "vampire" directory
and that it contains (a link to) the z3 library file "libz3.so" (unix) / "libz3.dylib" (mac).
In might be necessary to also make LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unix) / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (mac) contain the path
the this vampire's "include" dir.)

--- on the provided VM ---

- start the Terminal
- cd vampire
- git pull
- make vampire_z3_rel -j 3

should give us (as of 5 July 2018) vampire_z3_rel_master_3993


Exercise 1 - Limited Resource Strategy (LRS) and the time limit
---------------------------------------------------------------

Under certain conditions, LRS may behave in surprising ways. Because it actively discards
clauses which are estimated not to be useful before the allotted time is over, it may
prove things faster when given less time. Try playing with

./vampire_z3_rel_master_3993
